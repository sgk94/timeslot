# Timeslot Challenge

For this challenge I wanted to share more information about myself. The time slot app is called Game and Beats because I have been drumming for over 14 years now. I have also been playing video games for as long as I can remember. A common passion within these two hobbies is teaching. I used to teach drums as a part time job throughout college and high school. I also teach tactical fps on the side as a fun hobby. You will see the two available activities for users to choose from reflects this. 

## Technology Used

I used the React framework, JS, HTML and CSS.

## Level 1 Requirements

- [x] Show a button or CTA to schedule a new timeslot.
- [x] Clicking the CTA should open a form where you can save the timeslot details.
- [x] Display the timeslots that have been scheduled.

## Extra Credit

- [x] Enforce that all properties are included
- [x] Don't allow the start time to be after the end time
- [x] Don't allow scheduling a timeslot in the past
- [x] Include a sort option

## Test Cases

- User is required to fill out every field before submission is accepted
- User should not be able to submit the form with a date that is already passed
- User should not be able to submit the form if the end time is before the start time
- User should not be able to submit the form when they add a number of guest that exceeds the max number of guests allowed
